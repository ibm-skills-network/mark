- [ ] **Minor:** Small to medium changes, such as adding new functionality that is backward-compatible or minor refactoring. Moderate review needed.
- [ ] **Patch:** Bug fixes, small tweaks, or documentation updates. Light review is sufficient.

#### **Testing & Validation:**

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Added/updated to cover new logic or edge cases.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Updated to verify interactions between components.
- [ ] **E2E Tests:** Performed end-to-end testing in staging or development environment.

### **Purpose:**

<!-- Describe the problem being solved and how the changes address it. -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!--
This PR addresses an issue where the application fails to handle edge cases in the user profile update functionality. Specifically, the system was not correctly validating certain user input fields, leading to potential data corruption. The changes in this PR introduce more robust validation logic to ensure data integrity and prevent these errors.
-->

### **Context:**

<!-- Provide relevant links to Jira issues, design documents, or previous discussions on Slack. -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!--
- **Jira Issue:** [SKILLS-1000: User Profile Update Validation](https://jsw.ibm.com/browse/SKILLS-1000)
- **Design Document:** [User Profile Validation Update](https://box.com)
- **Previous Discussions:** [Slack Discussion on User Profile Validation](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C0765Q5FLR4/p1724076982965119)
-->

### **Basic Usage:**

<!--
Describe how this PR cause changes to the standard way users or developers interact with a part of the codebase.
Mention if README (Users) or CONTRIBUTING (Dev) docs need to be updated to reflect these changes.
-->
<!-- Example: -->
<!--
No changes have been made to the basic usage of the user profile update functionality. The validation logic has been enhanced internally, but the API and user interface remain the same. The README and CONTRIBUTING documentation have been reviewed, and no updates are necessary as the changes are backward-compatible.
-->

### **Notes to Reviewer:**

<!-- Use this section to provide important information to the reviewer. Highlight specific areas of the code where you would like the reviewer to focus their attention. -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!--
-  **Specific Areas to Focus:** Please pay close attention to the new validation logic in `UserProfileService.java`. This part of the code handles edge cases that could impact user data integrity. I'm particularly concerned about how it interacts with the existing data pipeline.
- **Known Issues/Limitations:** Currently, the solution does not handle cases where the user input exceeds 500 characters. I'm aware of this limitation and plan to address it in a future PR.
- **Requested Feedback:**  Please provide feedback on the approach taken to refactor the `OrderProcessor` class. Specifically, let me know if you think the new design improves readability and maintainability compared to the previous implementation.
