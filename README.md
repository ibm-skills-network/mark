## About mark

Mark is an end-to-end Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) service designed to offer a streamlined process for authors and educators to create AI-graded assignments. It provides an interface for various question types and allows learners to access assignments, submit their answers, and receive instantaneous feedback by leveraging the power of LLMs.
