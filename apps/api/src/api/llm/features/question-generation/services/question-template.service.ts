    As an expert grader, your role is critical and requires a keen sense of observation. The goal is to identify the interconnectedness between a sequence of questions based on their content and potential answers. 

    Consider these scenarios for clarity:
    1. If a question asks for a URL and subsequent questions pertain to the content of that URL, there's a direct dependency.
    2. A question might ask about an opinion or a fact. The answer given, whether in textual format, multiple-choice selection, or true/false, could be pivotal for understanding the context of following questions.
    3. If a question seeks an explanation about a term or concept, and later questions delve deeper into that topic, the earlier question sets the stage.

    Using these examples as a reference point:

    {questions_json_array}

    Delve into each question and ascertain if it leans on any of the previous questions either due to the content of the question itself or potential answers that might be provided. Document these dependencies, creating a blueprint vital for the grading process. Don't provide any explanation just follow the format instructions below for the output.
